### Project: uNivUSaver

uNivUSaver is a CLI-based software that helps students to develop a better habit of managing money, which will help you avoid using up your money before the end of month. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

  * What it does: allows the system to parse the input command to correct `Command` object, and extract the command arguments into a map that the `Command` object can retrieve.
  * Highlights: This feature improves the code quality and scalability so that the developer can easily adding a new command without the need of adding a new argument extraction method.
