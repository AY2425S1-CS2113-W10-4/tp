### Project: uNivUSaver

uNivUSaver is a CLI-based software that helps students to develop a better habit of managing money, which will help you avoid using up your money before the end of month. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Category Management System
    * What it does: Introduces a system to create and manage expense categories, such as "Food", "Entertainment", "Transport", etc., which helps users organize their expenses more effectively. The categories can be added, deleted, and customized by the user.
    * Justification: This feature enhances the usability of the application by allowing users to categorize their expenses, which helps in more efficient financial tracking and better budgeting insights. By providing default categories and allowing customization, users can maintain categories that best suit their individual needs.
    * Highlights:
      - Category Creation: Users can create new categories dynamically. The system prevents duplication by checking if a category already exists.
      - Default Categories: When the application starts without any predefined categories, default categories such as "Food" and "Utilities" are initialized for convenience.
      - Category Deletion: Users can remove categories they no longer find relevant. Deleting a category requires checking its existence to ensure smooth user interaction.
      - Interactive Category Addition: Allows users to add categories interactively, making the application more user-friendly.
